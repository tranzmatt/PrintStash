"""Job-state coverage for ``import_resolved_groups`` (collection fan-out).

Integration rather than unit, despite what it looks like: the Job is a ``jobs``
row, and that row has a foreign key to `users`. It lived under `tests/unit/`
while foreign keys were unenforced and an owner id of `1` could refer to nobody;
the tier guard rejected it the moment enforcement came back on.

The regression these guard: a collection where every member fails to download
must report the job as ``failed`` (not ``completed``), so the UI stops showing a
silently-broken import as success.
