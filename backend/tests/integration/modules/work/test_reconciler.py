"""A reconcile pass against the real database: repair, discover, and bound.

``decide`` (unit-tested) says what a Job needs; this file defends what a pass
*does* about it, on real rows and a real engine: submitting first attempts,
interrupting and resubmitting lost ones, failing exhausted ones and calling
their failure hook, finishing ones whose terminal write was lost. Discovery
creates one Job per pending subject, never more than the batch or the lane's
headroom allows, and holds back a subject that keeps coming straight back.

A pass is single-flight per definition, re-runs itself when a nudge lands
while it runs, and asks for a delayed pass at its source's next due time.
