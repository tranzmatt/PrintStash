# Proves `alembic upgrade head` from an old release's schema succeeds against
# the current migration chain, with no dangling foreign keys and no data loss
# afterward. Self-hosters upgrade in place — a broken migration here means a
# broken production install (see CLAUDE.md's rule against editing merged
# migrations).
#
# Usage: scripts/test_migration_upgrade.sh [from-tag]
#   from-tag defaults to the oldest release this branch still supports
#   upgrading from. Bump it forward as very old tags are dropped from support.
#
# Requires: git, uv. Run from the repo root.
